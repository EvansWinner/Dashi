## Overview

It turns out that there is already an [Emacs
Dashboard](https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard) on Melpa, which
is probably much more powerful than this. Dashi's point is to be simpler, less
opinionated, and to be easy to hack or to make your own cards and data items.


## To-dos

- **TODO** Fill out this README
- **TODO** Abstract and simplify the method for doing new data items, similar to
  how cards are done.
- **TODO** Pull out the rendering engines for items into a separate file
- **TODO** Pull out the rendering engines for cards into a separate file
- **TODO** Write some more example cards, including one using a REST request and
  maybe one doing web scraping of some kind
- **MAYBE** Do a rendering "engine" using SVG boxes

dashi.el --- Data Dashboards for Emacs

It turns out that there is already an [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][Emacs Dashboard]] on Melpa, which is
probably much more powerful than this. Dashi's point is to be less opinionated
and to make it easy to hack your own cards and data items.

** Overview

It turns out that there is already an [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][Emacs Dashboard]] on Melpa, which
is probably much more powerful than this. Dashi's point is to be simpler, less
opinionated, and to be easy to hack or to make your own cards and data items.

There are currently 7 types of things here. The first three are basic things:
 1. The core Dashi program
 2. The customization group and items
 3. The major mode

The other four are the ones you want to mess with:
 1. "Cards": This is a visual container for whatever data items you want to show.
 2. "Items": This is the actual data you want to display. This is really just
    any function that returns a string to show.
 3. The "rendering engine" for cards -- this defines how your cards will be displayed.
 4. The "rendering engine" for the items -- this defines how your data items will be displayed.
 
Don't be put off by the highfalutin terms. These are really just functions that return strings or take lists of those functions and decorate those strings with other strings. It's intended to be as simple as possible.
 
** To-dos

- TODO Fill out this README. How to write new rendering engines for cards and for items, and how to write new items and new cards.
- TODO Abstract and simplify the method for doing new data items, similar to
  how cards are done.
- TODO Refactor into separate files for --
  - TODO Rendering engines for items
  - TODO Rendering engines for cards
  - TODO Existing cards and items
  - TODO The major mode
- TODO Write some more example cards, including one using a REST request and
  maybe one doing web scraping of some kind
- MAYBE Do a rendering "engine" using SVG boxes

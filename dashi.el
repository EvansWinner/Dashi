;;; Commentary:

;; Do M-x dashi to get a temporary buffer with a "dashboard" of
;; "widgets" containing interesting facts. Write your own functions
;; and add them to dashi/widget-list and otherwise modify
;; dabbshi/widget-list to customize the output.

;; "Widgets" (groups of one or more peices of interesting information)
;; are just displayed in the buffer from top to bottom, in the order
;; in which they appear in dashi/widget-list.

;; Items are the actual functions that return the interesting
;; information. Widgets should call items. A widget can call as many
;; items as you want.

;;; Code:

;;; Vars

;; Each is a list (function title decorator) where function is a
;; function that returns an unadorned string with the datum you want
;; shown, title is the title of the widget, and decorator is a
;; function that decorates the widget in some way (e.g., a boxquote
;; function or similar). decorator may be nil for no decorator, title
;; may be nil for no title.  Example: (time-of-day "Current Time: "
;; dashi/box)

;; Sections: Emacs, buffers, time/date, files, folders, memory,
;; features, load-path, processes, timers, global modes,
;; functions/symbols
